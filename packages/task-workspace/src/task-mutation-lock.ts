/**
 * Cross-process task mutation lease.
 *
 * Serializes every mutation of one task's private data (head CAS, event
 * append, checkpoint writes, TurnCommitCoordinator sequences, review and
 * route mutations, recovery). The lock file lives at
 * `<base>/locks/task/<sha256(taskId)>.lock` and uses exactly the workspace
 * lock's lease format and staleness rules (see workspace-lock.ts): PID
 * liveness plus process start identity, never timeouts.
 *
 * LOCK ORDER: when a mutation needs BOTH leases, always
 *   task lease  ->  workspace lease
 * and never the reverse, or two writers can deadlock.
