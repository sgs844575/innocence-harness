/**
 * Attribution state machine for workspace changes observed while a task runs
 * (P1 plan, fixed transitions):
 *
 *   candidate → attribution-pending
 *   attribution-pending + task-owned → pending review
 *   attribution-pending + external → excluded + protected external version
 *   candidate overlap with expected write → conflict
 *
 * Pure functions only: persistence and enforcement live behind the
 * TaskRuntimePort (real implementation wired by Task 6); this package
 * orchestrates the port and exposes the decisions. While any decision is
 * unresolved (candidate, attribution-pending or conflict) the capture
 * middleware blocks new write tools, and hosts must apply the same gate to
 * task completion. Externally attributed paths carry a protected content
 * hash and must never be touched by task restore/apply (enforced in
 * Tasks 5/6 via {@link excludedPaths}).
 *
 * The ChangeSource/Attribution unions are task-core's canonical vocabulary
 * (single-sourced with the persisted event types — see
 * task-core/src/events.ts).
